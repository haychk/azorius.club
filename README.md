# azorius.club
azorius.club is a 1.12.2 anarchy client, which is based on OyVey with better and improved modules.
This should NOT be used as a main client, rather as a side client with another client such as Future. 
This client's main intention is to help me and Crimply learn Java and understand it better whilst being able to troubleshoot with ease.
